# ABMs-for-causal-inference
The respository 'ABMs for causal inference' archives the SAS code for comparing agent-based models and the parametric g-formula, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology in 2017 [1]. The code is also included as an appendix to the American Journal of Epidemiology publication. 

This repository includes code for simulating data with time-varying treatment-confounder feedback, and estimating the effect of treatment using an agent-based model and the parametric g-formula. This code demonstrates the potential for biases when using agent-based models for causal inference. Sas 9.4 was used for all analyses.
